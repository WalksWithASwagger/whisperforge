- **Article Prompt**: Created comprehensive article generation prompt
- **Live Application**: Prompts applied during content generation process

## 🔧 Technical Implementation Details

### Real-Time Streaming Architecture
```python
# Create expandable containers for each step
transcript_container = st.expander("🎙️ Transcription", expanded=False)
wisdom_container = st.expander("💡 Wisdom Extraction", expanded=False)
# ... etc for all 8 steps

# Stream content immediately after generation
with transcript_container:
    st.markdown("**✅ Transcription Complete**")
    st.text_area("Transcript", transcript, height=200, disabled=True)
```

### Prompt Loading System
```python
def load_custom_prompts():
    """Load custom prompts from the prompts directory"""
    prompts = {}
    prompt_dir = "prompts/default"
    # Load all .md files as prompts

def get_prompt_for_step(step_name: str, custom_prompts: Dict[str, str] = None):
    """Get the appropriate prompt for a pipeline step"""
    prompt_mapping = {
        'wisdom': 'wisdom_extraction',
        'outline': 'outline_creation', 
        'social': 'social_media',
        'article': 'article_generation'
    }
```

### Enhanced Aurora Styling
- **CSS Variables**: Proper Aurora color scheme with gradients
