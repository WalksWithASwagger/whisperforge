# WhisperForge: Cleanup & Product Roadmap

## 🧹 IMMEDIATE CLEANUP TASKS

### 1. Directory Structure Cleanup
**Current Issues:**
- Duplicate files across root and whisperforge/ directories
- Multiple backup files (.bak, .save)
- Scattered configuration files
- Test files in production directories

**Proposed New Structure:**
```
whisperforge/
├── src/                          # Main application code
│   ├── whisperforge/            # Core package
│   │   ├── __init__.py
│   │   ├── app.py              # Main Streamlit app
│   │   ├── core/               # Business logic
│   │   ├── integrations/       # External service integrations
│   │   ├── ui/                 # UI components
│   │   └── utils/              # Utilities
│   └── config/                 # Configuration files
├── tests/                       # All test files
├── docs/                       # Documentation
├── scripts/                    # Deployment/utility scripts  
├── data/                       # Data files, cache, uploads
├── static/                     # Static assets
└── deployment/                 # Docker, CI/CD configs
```

### 2. File Cleanup Priority
**HIGH PRIORITY - Delete These:**
- `clean.py` and `clean.py.save` (duplicate of app.py)
- `app.py.bak*` files
- `.DS_Store` files
- `spektor.log` and other log files
- Duplicate `requirements.txt` files

**MEDIUM PRIORITY - Organize These:**
- Move test files to `/tests/`
- Consolidate SQL schemas
- Organize static assets
- Clean up experimental files

### 3. Git Cleanup
**Actions Needed:**
- Remove large backup files from git history
- Update .gitignore for proper exclusions
- Create proper branch strategy
- Tag current working version as v1.0-alpha
