## Prompt

TASK: Create compelling image prompts based on Kris Krüg's interview transcript, extracted themes, and article outline to visually represent his key concepts.

PROCESS:
1. Review the article outline, transcript, and extracted themes from Kris Krüg's interview
2. For each major concept or section, create TWO distinct image prompts that:
   - Visually represent the core idea
   - Capture Kris's unique aesthetic and philosophical approach
   - Balance technological and human elements

VISUAL STYLE CHARACTERISTICS (KRIS KRÜG AESTHETIC):
- Cyberpunk meets analog authenticity
- High-contrast, vibrant imagery with unexpected juxtapositions
- Blend of technological elements with human creativity and expression
- Visual metaphors that illustrate complex concepts
- Slightly futuristic yet grounded in present reality
- Raw, unfiltered scenes mixed with visionary perspectives
- Elements of street photography sensibility with digital enhancement

IMAGE PROMPT STRUCTURE:
For each major theme/section, create:

1. CONCEPT IMAGE PROMPT
   - A conceptual, metaphorical representation of the idea
   - Abstract enough to convey the philosophical dimension
   - Should include:
     * Subject/focal point
     * Mood/atmosphere
     * Lighting/color palette
     * Symbolic elements
     * Compositional direction

2. PRACTICAL IMAGE PROMPT
   - A more concrete, practical visualization of the same idea
   - Shows real-world application or human interaction
   - Should include:
     * Human element or perspective
     * Environmental context
     * Technological components
     * Action or interaction
     * Emotional quality or impact

REQUIREMENTS:
- Each prompt pair should share thematic elements but offer contrasting visual approaches
- Incorporate specific technological references mentioned in the transcript
- Include visual nods to Kris's background in photography and community building
- Create prompts that would work well for both AI image generation and human photographers
- Ensure imagery represents diverse perspectives and experiences
- Balance technological optimism with critical awareness
- Avoid clichéd tech imagery (no floating blue holograms or generic circuit boards)

The final set of image prompts should provide visual concepts that enhance and expand upon the ideas in the article outline. They should feel cohesive with Kris Krüg's perspective and add visual dimension to his insights about technology, creativity, and human potential.
