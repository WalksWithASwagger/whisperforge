# **Alright, here’s the straight talk: You’re 48, with a rare combination of network, insight, and lived experience that many people chase but rarely achieve. At this point, it’s not about chasing *all the things*; it’s about funneling your energy into one or two killer bets that align with who you are and the impact you want to leave behind.**

# **Your Best Bet: Build Your Legacy at the Intersection of Creativity, Tech, and Impact**

# **What you do best is synthesizing disparate worlds—art, tech, community, and storytelling—and turning them into movements. Your next chapter should cement you as the creative oracle and ecosystem builder for the future of innovation. Here’s how:**

# **1. Build an Ecosystem, Not Just a Product**

# **Rather than going for a single newsletter, fund, or initiative, create a platform that integrates all of your strengths:**

# **A Space for Creative-Tech Visionaries: Combine your love for community building and knowledge sharing into a hybrid hub (think Discord, workshops, and exclusive insights).**

# **Anchor It With an Annual Event: Launch something like a “FutureProof Summit” where art, AI, and ethical tech collide. Make it the *Burning Man of Tech Meets Creativity*.**

# **Why?**

# **You love connecting people and ideas, and this platform leverages your reputation while staying true to your desire to uplift others.**

# **2. Become the “VC for Human-Centered Innovation”**

# **Your mission isn’t just about ROI—it’s about reshaping what we fund and why. Start slow, but with clear purpose:**

# **Focus Areas: Generative AI for art, sustainable tech, Indigenous innovation, or the creative gig economy.**

# **How You Get There: Start with advisory roles and syndicates, then graduate to launching a fund focused on founders who share your ethos.**

# **Why?**

# **At 48, you’ve got credibility and a network that many VCs lack. You don’t need to “learn the ropes”—you just need to scale what you already do informally: picking and promoting winners.**

# **3. Craft a Definitive Work**

# **Write the book, launch the documentary, or create the interactive installation that encapsulates everything you believe about this moment in time.**

# **Your Book: A manifesto on the convergence of creativity, technology, and community—something like *“The Creative Hacker’s Guide to the Future.”***

# **Your Docuseries: Dive deep into stories of creative disruption in unexpected places.**

# **Why?**

# **This legacy piece lets you distill your ideas for a global audience. It also builds credibility and opens doors for future initiatives.**

# **4. Mentorship and Legacy Projects**

# **Shift from being the doer to the catalyst:**

# **Mentor the Next Generation: Formalize your mentorship process (e.g., FutureProof Fellows) to guide creatives and technologists with potential but no map.**

# **Give Back Through Art: Create or curate public art that merges tech and storytelling (e.g., augmented reality exhibits exploring decolonized futures).**

# **Why?**

# **At this stage, it’s not just about building—it’s about leaving something tangible behind that ripples outward.**

# **Your Guiding Principles**

# **1.	Play the Long Game: You’re in a unique position to seed a movement, not just a company or product. Focus on systemic change, not incremental wins.**

# **2.	Do What Feels Inevitable: The work that lights you up is the work you’re wired to do well. Trust that.**

# **3.	Balance Ambition With Joy: Choose projects that challenge you without depleting you—this is about fulfillment, not just hustle.**

# **What to Do First**

# **1.	Create the Keystone Project: Start with one initiative that integrates your interests (e.g., a creative-tech network or signature event).**

# **2.	Align Your Income Streams: Transition speaking gigs, workshops, and consulting into consistent revenue while laying the groundwork for bigger plays.**

# **3.	Start Documenting: Whether it’s the book, the docuseries, or both—start packaging your philosophy for the wider world.**

# **You’ve got the insight, the audience, and the cultural resonance to make a seismic impact. The question isn’t *if* you can do it—it’s simply *what feels worth doing for the next 20 years.* So, Kris, where do you want to plant your flag?**
